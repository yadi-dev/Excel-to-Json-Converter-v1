# Excel to JSON Converter
This Python script allows you to convert multiple Excel files into a single JSON file. It's particularly useful when you need to combine data from various Excel spreadsheets into a unified JSON format.
## Features
- Convert multiple Excel files (.xlsx or .xls) to JSON
- Combine data from different Excel files into a single JSON file
- Preserve existing data in the output JSON file if it already exists
- User-friendly command-line interface with colorful output
## Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- pandas
- colorama
## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yadi-dev/excel-to-json-converter.git
   cd excel-to-json-converter
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install pandas colorama
   ```
## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```
   python pdftojson.py
   ```
2. When prompted, enter the names of the Excel files you want to convert. Press Enter without typing a filename to finish input.
3. The script will process each file and combine the data into a single JSON file named `data.json` in the same directory.
## How it works
1. The script reads each Excel file and converts it to a list of dictionaries.
2. Each Excel file's data is stored in the JSON under a key matching the Excel file's name (without extension).
3. If `data.json` already exists, the script will add new data to it without overwriting existing entries.
## Notes
- Make sure your Excel files are in the same directory as the script, or provide the full path to the files.
- The script will skip files that are not Excel files or cannot be processed.
- If a file with the same name (without extension) has already been processed, its data will not be overwritten in the JSON.
